# EEG-ImageNet-Dataset

This is the official repository for the paper "EEG-ImageNet: An Electroencephalogram Dataset and Benchmarks with Image Visual Stimuli of Multi-Granularity Labels".

The dataset is available for download through the provided cloud storage [links](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/d812f7d1fc474b14bbd0/). 
Due to file size limitations on the cloud storage platform, the dataset is split into two parts: EEG-ImageNet_1.pth and EEG-ImageNet_2.pth. Each part contains data from 8 participants. Users can choose to use only one part based on their specific needs or device limitations.
